# Dynamic Indexing Through Learned Indices with Worst-case Guarantees

This is the repository for the dynamic PGM and indexing structure as presented in the paper "Dynamic Indexing Through Learned Indices with Worst-case Guarantees".
The library is header only, requiring only the inclusion of the contents of the `convex_hull/` and `learned_index/` headers.

For a showcase of usage, as well as functionality for testing see anonymous.4open.science/r/LearnedIndexBench
